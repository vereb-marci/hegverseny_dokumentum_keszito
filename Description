Here, I'll write down ideas, key notes and anything I'll find necessary to complete this project.  
Note:  
I should upload some earlier documents in order to know what the end result should look like.  

#What it needs:  
- start with an input list of all the providers for each individual points
- than should come a map, where you can place each individual providers, assigning an index to each (e.g. 1-10 or A-H or something like this) *(might swap order with the previous score)*
- than input all the participating teams
- than comes the part where a schedule is made for the participants and providers  
needed parameters for that I can name currently: *(add items if necessary)*  
- number of providers
- number of participants
- available time for each spot (might be redundant)
- start and finish time
- number of breaks for the teams
- time when the providers can take a break
